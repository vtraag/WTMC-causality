Causality is at the root of many social science studies, yet often under appreciated. The most well-know aphorism "correlation does not imply causation" is actually false: it is possible to infer causality from correlations, under certain assumptions. In this method track you will become acquainted with some recent developments in causal inference. In particular, we will introduce the framework of Judea Pearl, which clarifies several long-standing issues in the social sciences: (1) what variables should you control for, and why; (2) what variables should you *not* control for, and why; and (3) how selection bias may affect results. The method is based on diagrams of direct causal effects, constructed on the basis on prior substantive knowledge, providing a structural causal model. Based on these causal models you can reason about what can and what cannot be concluded on the basis of observations. Moreover, it provides a tool to see how certain interventions will affect outcomes. Finally, although causal inference is often used in statistical settings, it by no means is limited to it. Causal reasoning finds a much broader application in scientific thinking, and will prove useful throughout your further studies.
